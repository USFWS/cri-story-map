The project will also improve the number of <a href='https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B0B3'>horned lark</a> breeding territories at Leadbetter Point to prevent local extirpation of the Washington Coast population. This will be accomplished through intensive habitat management of breeding and wintering habitats and reductions of disturbance stressors at the refuge and nearby <a href='http://parks.state.wa.us/537/Leadbetter-Point'>Leadbetter Point State Park</a>. Habitat restoration is anticipated to be on a scale where dynamic ecological processes can sustain the ecosystem in a natural state that requires limited future maintenance. These efforts can additionally benefit the state’s only known population of pink sand verbena plants, located at the refuge.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The American bullfrog, which is non-native to southern Arizona, has caused significant declines of other frogs and garter snakes in the area. Over the past 15 years, <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/buenos_aires/'>Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge</a> and a variety of cooperators have engaged in efforts to eliminate bullfrogs at landscape scales in and around the refuge. However, one area remains as the last stronghold for bullfrogs in the larger area. The project team will take a systemic approach to bullfrog eradication, including removal of bullfrogs with continuous measuring and monitoring of sites. These efforts will help eliminate impacts to threatened species, such as <a href='http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=D02F'>Chiricahua leopard frogs</a> and northern Mexican gartersnakes and increase persistence of both species on the landscape-level scale.

Recent surveys have indicated steep declines in threatened <a href='https://www.fws.gov/panamacity/flatwoodssalamander.html'>frosted flatwoods salamanders</a> as a result. In addition, a lack of frequent growing season fires can cause a decline in suitable vegetation in the ponds and impact the adjoining pine flatwoods where the salamander spends most of its life. On <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_marks/'>St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge</a>, the project team will reintroduce a more frequent and natural fire regime, use mechanical and herbicide habitat treatments, control feral hog depredation and place salamander larvae into covered artificial ponds to remove the main sources of mortality and help increase survival to metamorphosis. The juvenile salamanders will be returned to their pond of origin for the first two years, and afterwards to restored ponds with suitable upland habitat to facilitate repopulation. The restoration efforts will also benefit other species, such as the <a href='http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B04F'>red-cockaded woodpecker</a>, <a href='https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=C044'>gopher tortoise</a> and northern bobwhite. </p>",

Predation is a major pervasive threat impinging on productivity and survival of breeding Atlantic Coast piping plovers. Also, our rapidly changing climate, increasing popularity of beach recreation and growth of coastal development create growing and somewhat unpredictable threats. The project team will analyze variables that affect the rates of piping plover hatching success and adult mortality by expanding the scale and geographic range of data collection for nest exclosures (wire cages). The collection of hatching rates data will help with developing analytical tools for future management decisions.</p>",

The project team will conduct concurrent aerial surveys and boat-based surveys for two years in the Eastern Aleutians, which will allow the team to calculate a correction factor to estimate total abundance.

Loss of the dune habitat and infestation by invasive plants on remaining habitat is considered the cause of the Lange’s metalmark butterfly’s decline. Unprecedented dune restoration has begun and requires dune management, while continued weed abatement remains the most labor-intensive and costly endeavor towards recovery of the butterfly.  Nearby San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge’s existing nursery facilities will be used to propagate plants and harbor salvaged native plants for replanting. The project team will restore degraded dune habitat, replant dunes with native plants and remove invasive weeds that will improve foraging and breeding for the butterfly and benefit the two plant species.</p>",
