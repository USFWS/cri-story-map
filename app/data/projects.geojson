        "description": "<p>The critically endangered <a href='https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=Q2QW'><em>Serianthes nelsonii</em></a>, or fire tree, is native to Guam and the nearby island of Rota. Currently, only one adult tree of the species grows at <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/guam/'>Guam National Wildlife Refuge</a>, which has been impacted by termites; fewer than 50 mature trees remain on Rota.  15 outplanted seedlings currently survive on Guam Refuge. Threats to this species include high winds associated with typhoons, and an almost complete lack of regeneration because of predation by Philippine deer, feral hogs, and insects.  This project seeks to increase the capacity of of the Guam Refuge nursery to propagate and outplant seeds from the tree in areas free of deer and other hooved animals. The team will also install fencing to deter animals from feeding on seedlings.  The goal is to increase the number of fire trees from 15 to 45 individuals at four secured areas on the Refuge. Improvements to the Refuge nursery may also benefit other rare plant recovery projects on the Refuge.  Fencing will likely benefit the host plants for Hypolimnas octocula, a Candidate butterfly species, and recovery of understory necessary for Candidate tree snail species.</p>",

These same prairies have been extensively degraded by invasive non-native plants as well as annual and perennial weeds.</p><p>The project aims to improve the status of golden paintbrush with the goal of seeing it removed from the endangered species list. Team members plan to ensure at least 15 protected populations with more than 1,000 flowering plants each. On project sites including <a href=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/william_l_finley/'>William L. Finley</a> and <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/baskett_slough/'>Basket Slough National Wildlife Refuges</a> in the Willamette Valley, the team plans to use prescribed burning, mowing, herbicide treatments and tree and shrub removal to reduce invasive species and restore native prairie. Before the Service can propose delisting the plant, 20 stable populations of at least 1,000 flowering plants each must be distributed through its historic range.

The decline in Columbian white-tailed deer numbers was rapid with the arrival and settlement of pioneers in the fertile river valleys.  Conversion of brushy riparian land to agriculture, urbanization, uncontrolled sport and commercial hunting cause the extirpation of this deer over most of it’s range by the early 1900’s.</p><p>The project team aims to improve the status of the Columbian white-tailed deer by ensuring two viable populations of the species — one, at <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/julia_butler_hansen/'>Julia Butler Hansen National Wildlife Refuge</a>, and the other at <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ridgefield/'>Ridgefield National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

Work in the area to restore previously drained wetlands and re-fill unused irrigation pits is ongoing. However, when wetlands are bisected by ownership, restoration may not be an option. Recently, funds under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act were approved for the purchase of 120 acres of habitat that will place wetlands that were previously under partial private ownership completely under public ownership. Once the land is acquired, restoration of the habitat, which has been highly modified by pits, dikes, drains, sedimentation and fill activities, can move forward. The wetland protection and restoration, as well as watershed enhancement, will help provide reliable stopover habitat for the whooping cranes during both spring and fall migrations.</p><p>The long-term goals of this project are to enhance and restore high quality habitat in the Kansas-Nebraska Gap, enhance watershed functions by filling abandoned irrigation pits, protect wetlands by installing perimeter fence and increase water flow through culvert replacement. To achieve the goals, the project team will remove five irrigation pits in the watershed and two dugouts in the wetland, conduct plantings of high-diversity grasslands and forbs, including milkweed to benefit <a href='https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=I0WJ'>monarch butterflies</a> and replace area culverts.</p>",

The Kansas lesser prairie-chicken population has been designated to support 70% of the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies’ Conservation Plan five-state population goal. Within Kansas, habitat fragmentation, primarily from the eastern red cedar is the major threat to the lesser prairie-chicken. The recent explosion in eastern red cedar (23,000% increase) has caused reductions in lesser prairie-chicken habitat. Previous fire cycles once kept the eastern red cedar population in check, but those cycles have been altered. The goals of this project are to restore and/or enhance 15,000 acres of publicly and privately owned prairie habitat utilized by the lesser prairie-chicken for nesting and brood rearing on and near <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/quivira/'>Quivira</a> and <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/kirwin/'>Kirwin National Wildlife Refuges</a>. The project team will remove eastern red cedars, plant native grasses and shrubs and implement prescribed burning and grazing system modifications to include fence installation/removal and livestock water facility enhancements.</p><p>Added goals of the team are to implement grassland restoration projects and expand upon occupied acres to enhance the distribution and connectivity of populations and increase population size.

When cordgrass of a suitable height is not available, breeding rails may build nests in both low, sparse grass and higher, exposed areas, putting the nests at risk of destruction or predation. At Anaheim Bay, the low elevation of the marsh plain, a result of subsidence, results in cordgrass being totally submersed by only moderately high tides. As sea levels rise, the conditions at Anaheim Bay will be replicated in marshes throughout coastal southern California, putting the entire light-footed Ridgway’s rail population at risk.</p><p>Additionally, wetland migration inland is impossible for this highly urbanized area. The project team will apply a thin-layer of clean sediment over 10 acres of degraded cordgrass habitat and then conduct intensive monitoring of the area. If successful, this project could be a model for modifying land-locked urban habitats. The goals of the project are to ensure long-term survival of species by implementing sea-level rise adaptation strategy, conduct sediment augmentation of a pilot site to elevate marsh, improve cordgrass nesting habitat for the rail and increase the diversity and abundance of invertebrates on and near Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. Species that can additional benefit are the salt marsh bird’s-beak, Ridgway’s rail (formerly California clapper rail), salt marsh harvest mouse and Belding’s savannah sparrow.</p>",

Over the past 15 years, <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/buenos_aires/'>Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge</a> and a variety of cooperators have engaged in efforts to eliminate bullfrogs at landscape scales in and around the refuge. However, one area remains as the last stronghold for bullfrogs in the larger area. The project team will take a systemic approach to bullfrog eradication, including removal of bullfrogs with continuous measuring and monitoring of sites. These efforts will help eliminate impacts to threatened species, such as <a href='http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=D02F'>Chiricahua leopard frogs</a> and northern Mexican gartersnakes and increase persistence of both species on the landscape-level scale.

Recent surveys have indicated steep declines in threatened <a href='https://www.fws.gov/panamacity/flatwoodssalamander.html'>frosted flatwoods salamanders</a> as a result. In addition, a lack of frequent growing season fires can cause a decline in suitable vegetation in the ponds and impact the adjoining pine flatwoods where the salamander spends most of its life. On <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/st_marks/'>St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge</a>, the project team will reintroduce a more frequent and natural fire regime, use mechanical and herbicide habitat treatments, control feral hog depredation and place salamander larvae into covered artificial ponds to remove the main sources of mortality and help increase survival to metamorphosis. The juvenile salamanders will be returned to their pond of origin for the first two years, and afterwards to restored ponds with suitable upland habitat to facilitate repopulation. The restoration efforts will also benefit other species, such as the <a href='http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=B04F'>red-cockaded woodpecker</a>, <a href='https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=C044'>gopher tortoise</a> and northern bobwhite. </p>",

Predation is a major pervasive threat impinging on productivity and survival of breeding Atlantic Coast piping plovers. Also, our rapidly changing climate, increasing popularity of beach recreation and growth of coastal development create growing and somewhat unpredictable threats. The project team will analyze variables that affect the rates of piping plover hatching success and adult mortality by expanding the scale and geographic range of data collection for nest exclosures (wire cages). The collection of hatching rates data will help with developing analytical tools for future management decisions.</p>",

Wetlands in the middle of Green River, including those at <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ouray/'>Ouray National Wildlife Refuge</a> in Utah, provide crucial nursery habitat for the sucker, but recent habitat changes on the refuge, including construction of a levee, severed the connection between the Sheppard Bottom wetland and the Green River.

Human-related mortalities are the number one cause of death for Yellowstone grizzly bears. Recovery and linkage to unoccupied habitat westward in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem largely depend on how well humans accept bears, limit conflicts and limit human-caused mortality. The project team will implement conflict abatement measures, education and improve riparian corridors in sage-steppe landscape. It will reduce conflicts and human caused mortality and improve acceptance of grizzly bears around the <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/red_rock_lakes/'>Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge</a> in Montana.</p>",

The Eastern Aleutian management unit within the <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/alaska_maritime/'>Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge</a> has been identified as a high priority for further recovery due to the lack of abundance and trend information. Aerial and boat-based surveys can provide only rough estimates of abundance due to imperfect detection of sea otters. The project team will conduct concurrent aerial surveys and boat-based surveys for two years in the Eastern Aleutians, which will allow the team to calculate a correction factor to estimate total abundance. Refuge staff will provide critical support from their research vessel, R/V Tiglax, which provides a unique research platform that is ideal for accessing some of the most remote locations in Alaska, including the study area.</p>",

Loss of the dune habitat and infestation by invasive plants on remaining habitat is considered the cause of the Lange’s metalmark butterfly’s decline. Unprecedented dune restoration has begun and requires dune management, while continued weed abatement remains the most labor-intensive and costly endeavor towards recovery of the butterfly.  Nearby San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge’s existing nursery facilities will be used to propagate plants and harbor salvaged native plants for replanting. The project team will restore degraded dune habitat, replant dunes with native plants and remove invasive weeds that will improve foraging and breeding for the butterfly and benefit the two plant species.</p>",
