    "description": "<p>Prior to the mid 1800’s, the Willamette Valley was a complex mosaic of native upland and wetland prairies and dynamic river system supporting a rich array of plants and animals.  Since then, over 95% of the prairie habitat has been lost or degraded.  This has resulted in the drastic decline of the species that call these habitats home.  Working together with <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/baskett_slough/'>Baskett Slough</a>, <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/william_l_finley/'>William L. Finley</a> and <a href='https://www.fws.gov/refuge/ankeny/'>Ankeny</a> National Wildlife Refuges and partners this project seeks to accelerate conservation efforts to reclassify Fender’s blue butterfly from an endangered species to a threatened species, reclassify Bradshaw’s lomatium to threatened status and to delist the Oregon chub under the Endangered Species Act.</p>

    <p>On February 18, 2015, the Service announced the <a href='https://www.fws.gov/pacific/news/news.cfm?id=2144375359'>removal of the Oregon chub, and its critical habitat, from the list of Endangered and Threatened Species</a>, and the Oregon chub became the first fish ever to be delisted due to recovery. The team is also continuing its work to recover the <a href='https://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=I0IS'>Fender’s blue butterfly</a> and <a href='https://www.fws.gov/oregonfwo/species/data/bradshawsLomatium/'>Bradshaw’s lomatium</a>, a perennial herb in the parsley family.</p>",
